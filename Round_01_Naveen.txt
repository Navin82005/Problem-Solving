[1] Given an array a of n elements, task is to swap two number if the i > i + 1 and i + 2 > i + 3. If n in odd do nothing to n - 1
	def solution(a):
		n = len(a)
        for i in range(0, n - 1, 2):
            if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
                a[i], a[i + 1] = a[i + 1], a[i]
        return a

    1. Improvements
    Adding edge case
    if n < 2:
        return a

[2] Given a string, change every n'th consonant to its next consonant.
     - Traverse the string, and maintain a counter variable k.
     - Remove 1 from k when you encounter a consonant
     - when k is 0, change the i'th consonant to its next consonant
     - use a for loop to get the next consonant
    
    1. Improvements
    instead of using separate code block for upper and lower case characters
    using this
    c = chr(((ord(c.lower()) - ord('a') + 1) % 26) + ord('a'))

[3] Given a matrix, print the indexes that are divisible by 3 in the spiral order of the matrix
     - Define the Spiral Order Traversal.
     - Start from the top-left corner.
     - Move right across the top row, then down the last column, then left across the bottom row, and finally up the first column.
     - Shrink the boundaries after completing a full cycle and repeat until all elements are visited.
    
    1. Improvements
    instead of using a list to store the entire elements in the list, use a counter variable, and track it if it divisible by 3 then add the elements in to list.

[4] I used a brute force approach as i didn't had enough time to optimize  the code.
